        "U1-L3-Q01": "We are looking for an answer that is NOT supported by the table data.\nA. is supported by the data. Since by adding all the values would add up to 300\nB. is supported by the data. Since there is 300 students and 100 of them enjoy vanilla, that means that with a ratio of 100/300 a 1/3 of the students DID choose vanilla\nC. is supported by the data. Adding both chocolate and strawberry gives you 100, which means that again, 1/3 of the students chose either chocolate or strawberry\nD. is supported by the data. Adding both mint chip and coffee ice cream together yields a value of 75, and dividing this by the total of 300 gives you 1/4\nE. is not supported by the data. Adding vanilla and chocolate together yields a value of 165, which while it IS more than half of the students, is not exactly 1/2 of them.",
        "U1-L3-Q02": "B is the best answer choice here. The qualitative values given in the table represent relative frequencies, or the percentage that the categorical values show up. Multiplying 0.20 by the total sample population, 500, you get 100, which supports answer choice B.",
        "U1-L3-Q03": "The total counts of each value add up to 90. Adding key lime pies and pumpkin pies sold equals 30, and dividing this value by the total yields a percentage less than 50%."
