        "U1-L4-Q01": "C is the correct answer since it is the only statement that is false and therefore not supported by the table. We can see that answer C is false because it claims that more men chose a combination with black than a combination with blue, however the table shows the opposite as 44 men chose a combination with black and 56 men chose a combination with blue.",
        "U1-L4-Q02": "Based on the table, it appears that answers A through D are all correct but not E. Due to only being able to choose one answer, I went with answer E despite the question asking which statements IS supported by the table.",
