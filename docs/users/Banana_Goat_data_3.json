Since there is 300 students and 100 of them enjoy vanilla, that means that with a ratio of 100/300 a 1/3 of the students DID choose vanilla\nC. is supported by the data. Adding both chocolate and strawberry gives you 100, which means that again, 1/3 of the students chose either chocolate or strawberry\nD. is supported by the data. Adding both mint chip and coffee ice cream together yields a value of 75, and dividing this by the total of 300 gives you 1/4\nE. is not supported by the data. Adding vanilla and chocolate together yields a value of 165, which while it IS more than half of the students, is not exactly 1/2 of them.",

What makes C a better answer than E though is since there is so much data, the average will likely be lessened as a result.
